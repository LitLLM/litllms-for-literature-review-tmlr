Please select which candidate provides the best related works section (you can consider: the formal, the conciseness, whether the story is cohesive, and how well the approach is motivated). Your evaluation should also consider that all the references present in original related work are covered in the outputs of two assistants and penalize if the citation is missing. Do not allow the length of the responses to influence your evaluation. Please act as an impartial judge. Do not favor certain names of the assistants and ensure that the order of the responses does not affect your judgment. Be as objective as possible. Begin your evaluation by comparing the two responses and provide a short explanation avoiding any potential bias. Please remember that length of the responses is not a criteria for evaluation. \nOnce you carefully review both submissions, in a new line, choose the best answer between the answers of Assistant 1 and Assistant 2 by outputting the number as rating of 1 or 2 respectively, or choose 3 if the two assistants are equivalent.
